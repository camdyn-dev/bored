# bored
 
 originally started this since I wanted to practice with Fetch, will prob do something with a cooler API soon.
 was planning on fleshing this out but got bored with it when I noticed the limitations for example;
 > adding in `&participants=${num}` is somewhat pointless, since most categories (like busywork) only have single participant activites
 > accessibility is even more strict
 
 might come back to this and style it, but atm I'm gonna find something more interesting to work on
